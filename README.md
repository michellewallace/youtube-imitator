I am using the Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com) to advance my front-end web development skills.

This is my solution to the Embedding Images and Videos Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video

The goal of this project is to practice embedding media, so I focused mainly on embedding the video and side images and less on the other details of the page. You can view another project that focuses more on those details at https://github.com/michellewallace/google-homepage. I did use this project as an opportunity to practice layout techniques as well.

Key takeaways:
-Handling layout and positioning with CSS
-Embedding media
-Deepening familiarity with CSS selectors
